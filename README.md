## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub Pages. All changes to the `main` branch will automatically be build and deployed.

In case of a failure the latest successful deployment will stay available.

## Content

Content of the site can be managed in [`src/content/`](./src/content/).

**Ensure that after making changes the site still functions by running `bun run build && bun run preview` after making any changes in [`src/content/`](./src/content/).**

Alternately, to only check if the changes still match the collection schema `bun run check` can be run. Please note that this does not check for any visual faults nor does it check if the site can still be build (and be deployed).
