De Kom is the city theatre and art centre of Nieuwegein, a fairly young theatre built in 2012. The impressive building is designed by Frits van Dongen from Architekten Cie. The mission of De Kom is to be the cultural meeting point of Nieuwegein and allow people to develop their talents and gain extraordinary cultural experiences. This year the stage will be for exec(ut) conference and we will be provided with a room for talks, workshops and a lounge in which we will host the lunch, drinks and company stands. Take a break between the talks and workshops to take a bite and talk with our beloved companies!
