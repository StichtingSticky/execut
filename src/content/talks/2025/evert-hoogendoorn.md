Games aren’t just for fun—they can educate, train, and solve real-world problems. But how do you design a game that goes beyond entertainment? How do you ensure it actually achieves its intended goal?

This talk explores the world of serious gaming and playful learning, where games are used for education, training, healthcare, and social change. We’ll dive into the process of designing purposeful games, from identifying the core problem to defining clear learning outcomes before a single line of code is written. You’ll learn how game mechanics can drive engagement, how to balance fun with function, and why a well-structured development process is crucial for success.

Whether you're a developer, educator, or simply curious about how games can make a real impact, this talk will give you insights into designing games that are not just engaging, but truly meaningful.
