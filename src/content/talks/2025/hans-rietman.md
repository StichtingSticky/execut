Robotic prosthetics are transforming lives. But how did we get here? And where are we headed next?

This talk explores the fascinating history of prosthetic technology, from ancient wooden limbs to modern bionic arms controlled by the mind. We’ll dive into the state-of-the-art innovations in robotic prosthetics, including AI-driven movement, sensory feedback, and brain-computer interfaces that allow users to feel and control their prosthetics like never before.

Looking ahead, we’ll discuss what the future holds: Could prosthetics one day surpass biological limbs? And what ethical and technological challenges lie ahead?
Whether you're interested in robotics, medicine, or the future of human augmentation, this talk will provide a deep dive into one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing fields in technology today.
