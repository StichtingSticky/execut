    <p class="mt-4 sm:mt-8">
      If you would like to be part of the committee responsible for the next
      edition of exec(ut), you can let us know through
      <a class="text-green underline transition-colors hover:text-green/80" href="https://forms.gle/ehoZmBFGmfVs4sej7">this form</a> or
      by scanning the badge of one of the committee.
      The new committee will start in the summer of 2024, with the new
      conference taking place sometime between March and April of 2025.

      We estimate that as an organising member the workload is about 5 hours a
      week, although the distribution varies greatly throughout the year and
      also per role. The frequency of meetings also varies; either weekly or
      bi-weekly. Organising a conference is a lot of work, but also very
      rewarding and great fun!
