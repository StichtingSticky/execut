      If you would like to be part of the committee responsible for the next
      edition of exec(ut), you can let us know through
      <a class="text-green underline transition-colors hover:text-green/80" href="https://forms.gle/ehoZmBFGmfVs4sej7">this form</a>. The new committee will start in the summer of 2025, with the new
      conference taking place sometime between March and April of 2024.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 sm:mt-8">
      We estimate that as an organising member the workload is about 5 hours a
      week, although the pdistribution varies greatly throughout the year and
      also per role. The frequency of meetings also varies; either weekly or
      bi-weekly. Organising a conference is a lot of work, but also very
      rewarding and great fun!
    </p>
