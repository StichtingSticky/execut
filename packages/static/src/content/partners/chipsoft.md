As a leading provider of healthcare IT, ChipSoft supplies many Dutch and Belgian healthcare institutions with efficient and innovative software solutions. Integrated solutions within a single system – HiX – ensure that healthcare professionals can provide the right care at the right time.

With passionate developers and consultants, all dedicated to healthcare, the company develops solutions from its offices in Amsterdam, Antwerp, Heerenveen, and Hoogeveen. These solutions reduce the administrative burden for healthcare professionals, improve collaboration between healthcare institutions, and give patients more control over their treatment. In doing so, ChipSoft supports (large academic) hospitals, as well as general practitioners, mental health institutions, independent clinics, nursing homes, care homes, and home care organizations.

With HiX as a complete healthcare solution, institutions of all sizes are prepared for both the present and the future. Digital collaboration and data exchange between all parties involved in patient care play an increasingly important role in this.
